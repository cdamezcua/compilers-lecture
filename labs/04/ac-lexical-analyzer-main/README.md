# AC Lexical Analyzer

This project contains a lexical analyzer for the "ac" programming language, implemented using Lex.

## 📚 Language Description

The language has the following lexical rules:
- `f` → float declaration → `floatdcl`
- `i` → int declaration → `intdcl`
- `p` → print statement → `print`
- Identifiers are single lowercase letters except `f`, `i`, and `p` → `id`
- Integers → one or more digits → `inum`
- Floats → digits followed by a dot and 1 to 5 digits → `fnum`
- `=` → assignment → `assign`
- `+` → addition → `plus`
- Lines starting with `//` → `COMMENT`

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

1. Compile the scanner:
```
make
```

2. Run using the provided code generator:
```
make run
```

3. Clean all generated files:
```
make clean
```

## 🧰 Makefile Commands
You can use the following commands from the terminal:

- `make` → Compile the lexical analyzer from `lex_analaizer.l`
- `make run` → Generate random input using `code_generator.py`, print it, and show the corresponding tokens
- `make testcase` → Use the provided `test_case.ac` file, show it as input, and display the resulting tokens
- `make clean` → Delete generated files (binary, test inputs, etc.)

## 📁 File Structure
### Existing Source Files:
- `lex_analaizer.l` → Lexical analyzer definition
- `Makefile` → Build and test automation
- `code_generator.py` → Script to generate random AC language code
